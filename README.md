# 2k_bash_aliases
a collection of bash aliases meant to simulate the behivor of the windows 2k shell in linux. tested on ubuntu 24.4. either replace your alias file with the provided one or simply append your alias file.
at the moment, i've just scripted dir, cls and ipconfig. all are included in the provided file.

is any of this code at any efficient? no! this is for larp purposes only. the slower the script, the more larp correct it is.
